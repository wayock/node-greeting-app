1. What is a Node module?

A Node module is a set of functions that is included in an application.  Modules are like JavaScript libraries.


2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

module.exports is the variable that gets returned from require().  It is an empty object by default, and
it can be reassigned to anything.

exports is a reference to module.exports.  Any reassignment of exports will not be available outside of
the module.

exports is not returned by require() but module.exports is.


3. Why is using exports recommended?

Because exports is a reference to module.exports it cannot reassign the object module.exports

If you want your module to be a specific object type, using module.exports is preferred.  If you do not
plan on having the module be a specific object type, exports is preferred.
